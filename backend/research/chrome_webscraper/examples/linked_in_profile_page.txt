About
My destiny was given by my surname, csiba = computer scientist in bay area.
Generally I tend to enjoy most:
* tough problems to crack,
* owning/improving systems of value,
* backends over UI,
* quality over debugging, and
* doing over talking.
* On the people side I enjoy onboarding new folks, maintaining an inclusive culture, organizing trips and interviewing new hires.
Generally I do NOT like:
* companies in ads, social, productivity, security or scams. You can also find me swearing (in a foreign language) over crappy code, jira, long corporate processes and python env setup.

Parafin's mission is to democratize access to growth capital. We aim to enable and empower small businesses to reach their greatest potential, and to create a world in which their ability to acquire funding isn‚Äôt limited to a credit check or an arbitrary set of rules - which historically has limited numerous people from chasing their dream. We are located in San Francisco and are backed by prominent venture capitalists and the founders of Robinhood, DoorDash, Carta, Chime, and Plaid.

Education
Trojsten NGO mission is to bring together talented high school students of math, physics and computer science in Slovakia. We organized a competition during the semester and the best participants are invited for week long camps. After high school people in the community help each other out. Most of my achievements can be tracked down to this community.
In 2012 I was one of chief organizers of competition Naboj with over 1200 participants.

Computational Analysis of the Bidirectional Activation-based Learning in Autoencoder Task
IJCNN 2015
May 14, 2015
We use computational simulations to analyse the
behavior of the recently proposed Bidirectional Activation-based
Learning algorithm (BAL) which was inspired by the Generalized
Recirculation algorithm (GeneRec). Both algorithms avoid
biologically implausible backpropagation of the error signal, and
instead use propagation of neuron activations, which drive the

We use computational simulations to analyse the
behavior of the recently proposed Bidirectional Activation-based
Learning algorithm (BAL) which was inspired by the Generalized
Recirculation algorithm (GeneRec). Both algorithms avoid
biologically implausible backpropagation of the error signal, and
instead use propagation of neuron activations, which drive the
weight updates, using only local variables. We take a closer look at
the 4-2-4 autoencoder task for which, despite the task simplicity,
reliable convergence could not be achieved by either of the two
models. We propose the learning mode with two, significantly
different, learning rates (BAL2) that leads to considerably more
successful task learning. We also analyze various factors, related
to hidden activations, that contribute to further increase of the
learning success. In addition, we test BAL2 also on the large scale
database of handwritten digits, in which it yields relatively good
performance.
