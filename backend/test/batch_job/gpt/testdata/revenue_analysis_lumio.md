Given the data points, the plugin operates within the Education, Collaboration, and Interactive Learning spaces. While it has a Free Tier, it also has a Monthly Cost tying into its revenue generation.
## Lower Bound Estimate
Given that this is a plugin used primarily by educators and learners, there is a reasonable possibility that a significant portion of its user base is utilizing the free tier offered - especially within the context of public education or users from lower-income regions. Let's assume that only 5% of the downloads convert to paid users. With a standard low estimate of $5 for a monthly educational subscription and assuming an average of 6 months subscriber rate (to account for various factors including vacations and school terms), we have:

Lower Bound: $(46000000 * 0.05 * 5 * 6) = $69,000,000

A very loose assumption, hence the quite high lower bound as the provided data set isn't detailed enough to provide a more accurate estimate.

## Upper Bound Estimate
For the upper bound, let's be a little more optimistic and assume that as much as 10% of downloads convert to paid users and that these users maintain their subscription for an average of 9 months per year.

Upper Bound: $(46000000 * 0.10 * 5 * 9) = $207,000,000

Please note, this is a very optimistic scenario since we are considering the user base to be quite engaged and willing to spend on the tool which might not be the case in reality.

These are raw estimates and need readjustment based on further data points such as actual conversion rates, abandonment rates, pricing details, and more granular audience segmentation among others. For instance, the above estimates are based on global downloads. If we had data available to break these down by geography, the estimates could be much more precise.

Certainly an upper estimate of over $92,000,000 is feasible, but a more accurate estimate would require access to additional data points and metrics. Considering the aforementioned factors and potential for a lower conversion rate or a seasonal ebb and flow in subscriptions, it might be safer to assume a middle-path TTM revenue towards the lower range of the upper bound estimate.

At the very least, this exercise stresses the importance of having more granulate data when providing financial estimates and demonstrates the significant swing that can occur based on customer behavior.
