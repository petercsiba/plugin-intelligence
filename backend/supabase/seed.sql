**Data Points Analysis:**
The plugin Cross Reference by Davidrowthorn is featured in the Academic, Research, and Writing category and has integrations with various popular platforms such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Evernote, and Notion. It evidently appeals to a broad user base including individuals, researchers, and professionals who are required to manage references and labels in their documents efficiently.

**Developer Impact:**
Davidrowthorn does not typically commercialize their plugins, suggesting that this one may be a user acquisition tool.

**Business Importance:**
Given the plugin''s purpose and the platforms it integrates with, the plugin appears to be more of a minor feature addition rather than a core part of the business.

**Pricing Tiers:**
The plugin does not provide clear information about its pricing. So, the possible revenue will be calculated by assuming the standard pricing for such plugins.

**User Engagement:**
The plugin has 185,000 downloads over time. However, the number of active users might be significantly less considering potential abandoned users.

Based on these assumptions, we can consider a conversion rate of 0.5% of downloads to paid users (as per plugin 5). We assume $7 per active user per year (the average of plugin prices), as no pricing tiers are provided for this plugin.

As per these assumptions, the calculations would be:

Lower bound: `0.5% * 185,000 downloads * $7 = $6,475`
Upper bound: `2.0% * 185,000 downloads * $7 = $25,900`

So, the estimated range for the TTM revenue for the plugin would be

Lower Bound: $6,475
Upper Bound: $25,900
For the given calculations, we use the assumption that for each downloaded user, they contribute about $7 per year to the plugin''s revenue. This assumption is used due to the lack of specific price information for the plugin. Given more precise pricing information, these estimates might vary.', 'thread_OuyF2HpJUB1GWjv9JkrN0iRO', 'Davidrowthorn', 'https://www.davidrowthorn.net/', NULL, 'davidrowthorn', NULL, NULL, NULL),

This plugin is beneficial for individuals or teams using Google Cloud Build who want to streamline their communication and workflows for project management. Pricing information may vary depending on the Google Cloud Build usage and any associated charges for using Google Chat.', 0, 0, 'Given the details provided, let''s proceed with a revenue estimation for the `Google Cloud Build for Google Chat` plugin by categorising the users and estimating the conversion rates based on the nature of the plugin and the developer''s business model.

In this case, I will assume three main types of users: ''personal'', ''prosumer'', and ''small business''. Large companies and developers have been omitted due to the specific nature of the plugin and the associated costs.

- Personal users, who likely use this plugin for personal projects.
- Prosumer users, who likely use it for work-related projects in small teams.
- Small business users, who likely use the plugin for commercial projects.

Assuming the distribution of users is `personal(40%)`, `prosumer(30%)`, `small business(30%)`.

For each user type, I will then estimate two key values:

- \(A\): An average annual revenue per user
- \(B\): The conversion rate from free to paid users.

Let''s determine these estimates based on the data provided.

1. Personal: Given the nature of this plugin integrating Google Cloud Build with Google Chat, personal users may not be inclined to upgrade to paid features. So, \(A_{personal} = $0\) and \(B_{personal} = 0%\).
2. Prosumer: They are more likely to pay for extra features but not as disposable to spend as the small businesses. So, \(A_{prosumer} = $10\), and considering the low conversion rates stated in Plugin 5, \(B_{prosumer} = 0.4%\).
3. Small Business: They are most prone to buying the paid services because it could be critical to their operations. So, I will estimate \(A_{small} = $20\) and \(B_{small} = 0.5%\).

Now, let us estimate the TTM revenue lower and upper bounds by taking into account the estimated annual revenue per user \(A\), the conversion rate \(B\), and the total number of users (650000).

Lower bound estimates are calculated under the assumption of lowest possible revenue and conversion rates:

\(R_{lower} = B_{personal} \cdot A_{personal} \cdot U_{personal} + B_{prosumer} \cdot A_{prosumer} \cdot U_{prosumer} + B_{small} \cdot A_{small} \cdot U_{small}\)

Upper bound estimates are calculated by considering the same parameters except with replacing \(B\) by its upper range in the conversion rates:

\(R_{upper} = 2 \cdot B_{personal} \cdot A_{personal} \cdot U_{personal} + 2 \cdot B_{prosumer} \cdot A_{prosumer} \cdot U_{prosumer} + 2 \cdot B_{small} \cdot A_{small} \cdot U_{small}\)

Note: Even though it is mentioned as ''Free'', there could some indirect revenues. Let''s consider it negligible due to the highly technical and specialised nature of the plug-in and lack of premium tiers.

The calculation for revenue becomes as follows:

Lower Bound: $0
Upper Bound: $0

The estimated TTM revenue for the Google Cloud Build for Google Chat plugin ranges from $0 to $0 due to the lack of premium pricing tiers and absence of direct revenue streams. This plugin serves as an example how some offerings specifically intended to bolster the ecosystem, might not be directly monetized.

Given the pricing structure and the user base, we can make an estimate based on an assumed conversion rate of 1% of the number of downloads, with an average churn after 6 months.

Assume 1% of these users convert to paid. This gives us 1,500 paid users. Considering the different pricing tiers, we can distribute this to 70% for Basic Tier and 30% for the Pro Tier.

Therefore, we would have around 1050 users on Basic Tiers and around 450 users on Pro Tiers.

If we assume an average churn after 6 months, we would need to double this for the yearly revenue.

Given the 6-month churn rate, TTM revenue calculations would be:

Subscription Revenue from Basic Tier: $10 * 1050 users * 2 (to annualize) = $21,000

Subscription Revenue from Pro Tier: $20 * 450 users * 2 (to annualize) = $18,000

Therefore, the total TTM revenue estimate from the paid users would be:

Lower Bound: $0 (Free users)
Upper Bound: $21,000 (Basic Tier) + $18,000 (Pro Tier) = $39,000

Please note this is a rough estimate and the actual values may differ significantly based on the conversion rate and average churn rate, which are assumed in this analysis. The actual revenue might be lower or higher based on the actual conversion rates and user retention.', 'thread_BJr20K6EzteDpvC89lmNTN0c', 'Cloudappsbackup.com', 'https://www.cloudappsbackup.com/', NULL, 'cloudappsbackup-com', NULL, NULL, NULL),

1. **User Segmentation:** For this add-on, we might have personal users utilizing the free tier and businesses using the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise tiers. We can assume the distribution of users across tiers based on similar add-on demographics. Considering a conservative estimate, we might think the following: 95% free users, 3% Starter Tier, 1.5% Pro Tier, and 0.5% Enterprise Tier.

2. **Price Per User:** Using the given prices per month and the number of months in a TTM (12), we can calculate the price per user for each tier: $0 for Free Tier, $120 for Starter Tier, $300 for Pro Tier, and $600 for the Enterprise Tier.

3. **Number of Paid Users:** Given the number of total users (149000) and the percentages per tier, we can estimate the number of paid users.

4. **Revenue Per Tier:** The revenue per tier is calculated as the number of users in that tier times the price per user.

To ensure we capture both potential under and overestimation, we will define two different scenarios:

**Scenario 1 (Lower Bound):** In this scenario, we take a conservative conversion rate of 0.3%, which is indicated as a low conversion rate in the given key points.
**Scenario 2 (Upper Bound):** Here, we consider a 0.5% conversion rate, which is the higher end of the given spectrum.

The following calculations will be done for each scenario:

- Number of Free Users: `Total Number of Users * Free Users %`
- Number of Starter Tier Users: `Total Number of Users * Starter Tier % * Conversion Rate`
- Number of Pro Tier Users: `Total Number of Users * Pro Tier % * Conversion Rate`
- Number of Enterprise Tier Users: `Total Number of Users * Enterprise Tier % * Conversion Rate`

- Revenue from Starter Tier Users: `Number of Starter Tier Users * Price per User for Starter Tier`
- Revenue from Pro Tier Users: `Number of Pro Tier Users * Price per User for Pro Tier`
- Revenue from Enterprise Tier Users: `Number of Enterprise Tier Users * Price per User for Enterprise Tier`

Finally, the total revenue is calculated by summing up the revenue from each tier.

The revenue is calculated as follows for each scenario and is output in Markdown formatting:

**Scenario 1 (Lower Bound):**

* Number of Free Users: `149000 * 0.95` = 141550 users
* Number of Starter Tier Users: `149000 * 0.03 * 0.003` = 133.74 ≈ 134 users
* Number of Pro Tier Users: `149000 * 0.015 * 0.003` = 66.87 ≈ 67 users
* Number of Enterprise Tier Users: `149000 * 0.005 * 0.003` = 22.29 ≈ 22 users

   * Revenue from Starter Tier Users: `134 * $120` = $16080
   * Revenue from Pro Tier Users: `67 * $300` = $20100
   * Revenue from Enterprise Tier Users: `22 * $600` = $13200

Total Revenue = $16080 + $20100 + $13200 = $49380

**Scenario 2 (Upper Bound):**

* Number of Free Users: `149000 * 0.95` = 141550 users
* Number of Starter Tier Users: `149000 * 0.03 * 0.005` = 222.75 ≈ 223 users
* Number of Pro Tier Users: `149000 * 0.015 * 0.005` = 111.38 ≈ 111 users
* Number of Enterprise Tier Users: `149000 * 0.005 * 0.005` = 37.13 ≈ 37 users

   * Revenue from Starter Tier Users: `223 * $120` = $26760
   * Revenue from Pro Tier Users: `111 * $300` = $33300
   * Revenue from Enterprise Tier Users: `37 * $600` = $22200

Total Revenue = $26760 + $33300 + $22200 = $82260

From this analysis we can estimate that the TTM revenue of the Apptivo by Apptivo add-on lies within the range of $49380 to $82260.
